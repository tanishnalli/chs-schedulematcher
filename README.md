# CHS Schedule Matcher
![Logo](images/logo.png)
## What is this?
This is a schedule matcher that can tell you who is in your classes without the hassle of asking everyone individually.


## How did we come up with this?
During pioneer day, it was a pain to find out which of your friends were in your classes. So, we thought of a way
to make that process way easier. Thus the CHS Schedule Matcher was created.

## How do you use it?
To use it, write your name and year in the given search fields. Enter in the teachers that you have for all periods listed and then click enter.
